<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a civil engineering honours graduate who spent 26 years in the construction sector, including a year on site as part of the team constructing the Channel Tunnel and six years as a site manager constructing 1000 residential apartments in London.</p>

<p>I am looking for a new career with more flexibility and less moving around. I have an aptitude for problem solving and I have embarked on a learning path in web development and coding.</p>

<p>I discovered Angela's full stack development course on Udemy and started working through it in December 2024. I'm excited to see what doors this could open.</p>
